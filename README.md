# DevTown1 Loan Approval Analysis

## Conclude

### Loan Approval Analysis
In this dataset, I observed that males tend to receive higher loan approval rates compared to females. Additionally, the dataset distinguishes between two categories for both males and females: graduates and non-graduates.

### Predictive Model
My goal is to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on various factors, including credit score, income, age, marital status, and gender. This predictive model serves both the applicants and the bank by reducing the risk of defaults.

### Classification Problem
This project addresses a classification problem where I aim to determine, based on the applicant's information, whether they are likely to repay the loan or not.

### Methodology
My approach involves three key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I perform EDA to gain insights and a better understanding of the dataset. This includes visualizing data, identifying patterns, and assessing data quality.

2. **Preprocessing:** To prepare the data for modeling, I clean, transform, and handle missing values as needed. This step ensures that the data is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Model Testing:** I employ various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to create a predictive model. These models are trained and tested to make accurate predictions regarding loan approval.
